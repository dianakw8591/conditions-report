Snow Report is a posting site for associating moutain photos with the local snowpack at the time of the post. Search functionality allows a user to search a specific area for posts with a snowpack within a certain range. For example, a user could find posts (and pictures) from the Stevens Pass area when the snowpack was around 100".
